## Golang Projects

This repo contains all the mini projects I have built to transform myself from a beginner to a pro Golang developer.

These projects are meant to serve as practice applications.
Following the list of all the projects contained in this repo:
| Project | Description|  URL |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | 
| json-countries | RESTful API for getting info regarding countries, inspired by [Rest countries](https://restcountries.com/) | [Link](https://github.com/rakesh-gupta29/golang-projects/tree/json-countries/json-countries)
